## ðŸš€ About Me
What according to you are the **attributes** that best define a personality?

Is it the way they communicate their ideas, or the way they treat other people particularly those who can do no favors to them, define them?

Is it the calmness in their demeanour, or their storytelling skills that make them a magnetic personality?

**Well, these were the questions that bothered me a lot while I was in exploration of defining my own attributes.**

I explored my interests, and tried many things starting from **Music** to Poetry, Standup Comedy to **Content Writing**, to find my **IKIGAI**.

Just like the different versions of softwares, I had a different personality crafted for different ocassions.

I was great at Mathematics and I knew Mathematics was for me. When I studied Economics, I realised Economics is the definitely for me.

When I started a small business with my friend, I was certain Business is for me. After my studies, when I landed a job, I understood job is for me.

But just like a Machine Learning problem, this time I was not concerned with the outcome, but I was more interested with the hidden patterns lying under.

**Here are the interesting findings from my Life's ML Model:**

    1. I love problem solving and that's why at every point when I was thrown a challenge, I took it and completed it.
    2. I love to go into the depths and find the origin point to understand where everything originated from. 
    3. I am a big fan of doing it right vs doing it fast.
    4. I don't like to be the smartest person in the room. I have hunger to learn, to grow and expand my horizon.

All this, led me on a journey of self exploration and I landed on Data Science Domain.

**Here I am to utlise my potential to solve bigger problems, contribute more and work as per my SWADHARMA/ My IKIGAI.**
