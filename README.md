### Data Scientist in Making | Problem Solver

#### Welcome to my GitHub profile! 

In almost every story I heard in my childhood, there was a protagonist who embarked on a journey to explore something and in the journey, he faced a lot of **challenges**, discovered something new, **transformed** himself along the journey and finally reached his goals, **attaining** what he went out for. The story almost ends there and it is a happy ending where hero achieves what he wanted. 

I loved these stories, not particularly because of the ending, but because of the **journey**. I loved the fact that achieving something was never easy, and the protagonist always had to face challenges, and evolve himself along the way. 

I grew up listening to these stories and somehow they became a part of my life, in such a way that they shaped my current thinking, and personality. This made me a **process oriented** personality, who is in love with the journey, the process, and the transformation it brings.

Hi, I am Gajendra and I am a passionate life who loves to face challenges, discover something new and transform himself along the journey. After studying Economics in Graduation, serving as an Ecommerce Executive for around 1.5 year, I am now stepping into the world of Data Science fully prepared. 

My Economics background helped me grasp statistic and machine learning concepts easily as I quit my job to pursue data science with Great Learning's post graduate program in data science and engineering. After spending almost 10 months in building the right foundation, I am now ready to take on new challenges.

I carry a zeal about facing challenges and solving problems and keen on blending my love for problem-solving with my technical skills to create meaningful solutions in the field of Data Science and AI . My multifaceted personality with diverse interests, help me bring a unique perspective to my work.
